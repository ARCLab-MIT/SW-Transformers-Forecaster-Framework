    "The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common loss function for regression problems, including time series forecasting. It calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. MSE is popular because it is computationally efficient, differentiable, and works well with various optimization algorithms. However, MSE is highly sensitive to outliers, meaning that large errors can disproportionately influence the model's learning process. This sensitivity can be problematic in time series forecasting, where outliers might represent anomalies or unusual events rather than the underlying data pattern. Therefore, this loss function could be particularly well-suited for **periods where volatility is usual**, such as during high solar activity levels."
